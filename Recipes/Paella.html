          <h1>Paella Mixta</h1>
          <p>
            Mixed paella is an emblematic dish of Spanish gastronomy that
            combines the best of the sea and land in an explosion of flavors and
            colors. This recipe traditionally includes a mix of fresh seafood,
            such as prawns, mussels and squid, along with land-based ingredients
            such as chicken, rabbit or pork. Accompanied by bomb rice, fresh
            vegetables and a careful selection of spices, mixed paella is a
            delicious representation of the culinary richness of the
            Mediterranean region. Here is a recipe to prepare this feast of
            flavors in the comfort of your kitchen.

            <h2>Preparation time</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Total: Approximately 35 minutes</li>
              <li>Preparation: 10 minutes</li>
              <li>Cooking: 25 minutes</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a large paella pan or frying pan, heat a little olive oil over
              medium-high heat. Add the chicken and chorizo, and cook until
              golden brown on all sides. Remove and reserve.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the same paella pan, add a little more oil if necessary and
              sauté the onion, garlic and peppers until tender and fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the grated tomatoes and cook for a few minutes until a thick
              sauce forms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the mussels and prawns to the paella pan. Add the rice and
              stir well so that it is infused with the flavors of the
              ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the hot broth over the paella and add the saffron or food
              coloring. Adjust salt and pepper as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the paella boil over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Then,
              reduce the heat to medium-low and place the squid and peas on top
              of the rice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continue cooking the paella for about 15-20 more minutes, or until
              the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. Make sure
              not to stir the paella too much while it cooks so that the rice
              forms a delicious crispy layer on the bottom, known as "socarrat."
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the rice is cooked and the seafood is pink and cooked
              through, remove the paella from the heat and let sit for a few
              minutes before serving.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serve the mixed paella hot, garnished with a few sprigs of fresh
              parsley and accompanied by lemon wedges to squeeze over the rice
              if desired.
